# Supervised-Learning-Rules-in-Spiking-Neural-Networks 
spikesMatchOptInputFixed.c contains an implementation of the spike-matching algorithm described here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03199
It generates a reference and naive weight matrix for Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neural networks and changes the weights of the naive matrix to eliminate spikes unpaired after application of a dynamic string matching algorithm. 

spikesMatchOptInputSpikeData.c allows the user to pass in spike data from an external source. In the manuscript referenced above, this file was used to discover a LIF network that reproduced critical PIF neural activity.

analyze_data.m iterates through all of the data sets and computes vanRossum distances and spike statistics and must be called before make_plots.m

vRossum.m is a Matlab script that calculates the adapted van-Rossum distance measure used in the text. Four files generated by either of the two previous files should be saved in the path as "refSpikes.txt", "newOptSpikes.txt", "oldOptSpikes.txt", "controlOptSpikes.txt."

isiAnalysis.m similarly calculates inter-spike interval distributions and basic spike statistics.
